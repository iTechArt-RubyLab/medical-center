The most difficult task:

The most difficult task was to work with grape for the first time, we had to figure it out a lot, but in the end we conquered it.

The most interesting task:

To be honest, we can't single out any specific task because of the large number of requirements, many of them seemed useful and interesting to us.


What could we do if we had more time?

Firstly we would finish the remaining features, and after that we would do code refactoring. We would also make our documentation more native using special tools.
